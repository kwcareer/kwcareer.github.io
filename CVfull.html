	<li>Temporary position via Unitemps.</li>
	<li>A position with funds limited to about eight weeks, though I extended that by working fewer hours per week.</li>
	<li>The aim was to produce a system to predict the energy use of the experiments run in the glasshouses.</li>
	<li>Previous experiment data was collected from records and by consultation with experimenters.</li>
	<li>Required the development of an SQL database (in MS Access or otherwise).</li>
	<li>This has also involved programming Access using VBA (for the mathematics of the prediction), however moving to a web based solution was considered more suitable as it would be cross platform and independent of proprietary software.</li>
	<li>With the limited time and data available I managed to produce a prototype system using a linear model that worked within the bounds of the available training data, but more time and varied data were required to produce a usable system, sadly limited funds prevented this.</li>
